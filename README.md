1. Sort Algorithms（Sorting by price, popularity etc in e-commerce websites）： 
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort
    Bucket Sort
    Heap Sort
    Counting Sort
2. Search Algorithms（Used in artificial intelligence to build bots, for instance a chess bot. Finding shortest path between two cities in a map and many other such applications）:
    Binary Search (in linear data structures)：When you search for a name of song in a sorted list of songs, it performs binary search and string-matching to quickly return the results.
    Depth/Breadth First Search (in Graph data structures)
3. Hashing(
    In routers, to store IP address -> Path pair for routing mechanisms
    To perform the check if a value already exists in a list. Linear search would be expensive. We can also use Set data structure for this operation.
